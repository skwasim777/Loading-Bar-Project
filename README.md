# Loading Bar Project

This simple web project creates a loading bar animation that visually represents the progress of a task. The project consists of three main components: an HTML file, a JavaScript file, and a CSS file. It displays a loading bar with a counter showing the percentage of completion. The bar fills from 0% to 100% over a period of time.


## Project Structure
The project directory contains the following files:

1. 'index.html': The HTML file that defines the structure of the web page.
2. 'index.js': The JavaScript file responsible for controlling the loading bar animation.
3. 'style.css': The CSS file that styles the web page.
## How the Loading Bar Works

The loading bar starts at 0% and gradually progresses to 100% to indicate the progress of a task. This is achieved through JavaScript animation, and the percentage is displayed on the web page.

Here's how it works:

1. The HTML file (index.html) defines the structure of the page, including a container, the "Loading" text, a percentage counter, and two horizontal bars representing the loading progress.

2. The JavaScript file (index.js) is responsible for controlling the loading animation. It selects the elements to update (the percentage counter and the front loading bar), and it iteratively updates the percentage and the width of the loading bar.

3. The CSS file (style.css) provides styling for the web page. It defines the appearance of the loading bar, fonts, colors, and positioning.


## Running the Project
To run this project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Download the project files: Make sure you have the index.html, index.js, and style.css files.

2. Place the files in a directory on your computer.

3. Open the index.html file in a web browser to view the loading bar animation.
